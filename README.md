# BSAtool

This project implements two bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) strategies.

Conventional high- vs. low-bulk comparison.

Recessive-trait mode. For single- or two-gene recessive traits, the “low bulk” can be replaced by the average parental SNP-index, calculated as (SNP-index_Parent1 + SNP-index_Parent2)/2.

The fourth-power Euclidean-distance statistic (ED⁴) was computed with the custom script ED4.py.
